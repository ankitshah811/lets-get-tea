      To an extent, this was born out of my desire to meet interesting people, but beyond that, I believe we're all people with stories worth sharing and hearing. Learning strangers' stories is humanizing and humbling. Eventually, I'm hoping this will extend far beyond me and that strangers that sign up meet each other irrespective of my involvement.

      Random things you might care to know about me: I'm a designer and product guy at a startup in the Valley called Dwellers. In the past, I've been lucky enough to spend time working with Holstee and traveling all over India and Europe. In high school, I was voted 'School Sleepyhead.' I'm fairly certain Aziz Ansari hates me. I was raised in Long Island, and I'm weirdly proud when people tell me they wouldn't have guessed that. I'm really tight with my family, and I've always been the baby of the family. I like to think of this experiment as a personalized, non-gender-specific, non-sexualized Tinder. Except I swiped right on everybody.

    <p class="center">
      Still not convinced? Here's a little profile of you:
    </p>
    <p>
      You’re a recent grad yourself. You're the last person to ever meet a stranger over tea. You think stuff like this is super cheesy and only meant for followers of stuff like <a href="http://youtube.com/user/soulpancake">Soul Pancake</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/humansofnewyork">Humans of New York</a>. You go to college nearby. You’ve lived in the Bay your whole life and want to impart some appreciation for the area in a doubtful New Yorker. You, like me, just moved here. You’re about to move away from here. You work in tech. Better yet, you don’t work in tech.
    </p>
    <p>
      You like smiling for no reason. You like hanging out in coffee shops. You like going on hikes and pretending you’re in Narnia. You think about your dreams a lot. You think about Jay-Z a lot (or John Mayer, Mumford and Sons, Justin Bieber, Hans Zimmer, Kaskade, whatever). You don’t quite know why you’re in the Bay Area. You’re wondering if you belong somewhere else. You’re very self-conscious. You don’t know why people are so self-conscious. You’re very health conscious but cookies don’t count. You’re incredibly impulsive. You think too much. You often paint pictures of what the world would look like if you did ___. You know you should exercise more but you’ll get to it tomorrow. You made a plan today and that deserves a pat on the back. You’ve traveled extensively. You’ve planned your future travels extensively. You’re a person. It doesn’t matter what your thing is — I very purposefully want this to be open-ended. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe you're a vegan. Maybe you hate them. Maybe you're a grandmaster chess player. Maybe you're more of a Monopoly person. Or Taboo. Or Apples to Apples. You might work in finance. You might not have time for cheesy stuff like this. Maybe you love your job. Perhaps you hate it and you're feeling the need for some soul searching right now. For all I know, you hold a Guinness World Record. You were raised on a farm. Maybe you have a Ph. D.. I don't know. I'm running out of random things, but there's a good likelihood you might not fall into ANY of the things I just rambled on and on about. You're probably a unique snowflake. And that's why you should come.</p>
